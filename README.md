# Git Assignment - <Your git_assignment>
 
a. What is an issue?
An issue is way to track tasks or other types of work within a project

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request is a feature that allows you to propose changes to a codebase and request that those changes be reviewed and merged into a target branch.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

Create and Push Your Branch: Create a new branch, make changes, commit, and push it to the remote repository.

Open a Pull Request on GitHub: Go to the repository, start a new pull request, select base and compare branches, and submit the request.

Post-Submission Actions: Review feedback, make any additional changes, merge the pull request, and optionally delete the branch.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

To add a collaborator to a GitHub repository with write permissions, go to the repository on GitHub and click on "Settings." Select "Collaborators & teams" from the sidebar, then click "Add collaborator." Enter the collaboratorâ€™s username or email, select their access level, and click "Add". The collaborator will receive an invitation to join the repository with the specified permissions.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a distributed version control system for managing code changes, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates collaboration through features like pull requests and issue tracking.

f. What does git diff do?

git diff shows the differences between files or commits. It highlights changes made to the codebase by comparing the current state of the working directory or staging area with a previous commit or between two commits.

g. What is the main branch?

It is the default branch in a Git repository where the stable, production-ready code is typically maintained and where new changes are merged after they have been reviewed and tested.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

In a new repository, it's generally recommended to create and work on feature branches for new changes, rather than pushing directly to the main branch. This practice allows for code review, testing, and isolation of features or fixes before merging them into the main branch, which helps maintain a stable and clean codebase.
